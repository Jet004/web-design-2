                <h1>About ML Strength</h1>
                <p>
                    We are a Brisbane based company with clubs at Ashgrove, Brisbane City, Chermside, 
                    Graceville and Westlake.
                </p>	 
                <p>
                    ML Strength are Australia's newest brand in health and fitness, with gyms opening throughout 
                    the Brisbane metropolitan area. ML Strength believes fitness comes first and keeping fit and 
                    improving your health is not just a fad - it's a way of life. Whether your goal is weight 
                    loss, body building, nutrition or diet improvements, having more energy, or just looking and 
                    feeling better - we're here for you!
                </p> 
                <p>
                    ML Strength can offer cutting edge exercise options, including group fitness classes and 
                    one-on-one personal training sessions for weight loss, circuit training, boxing and karate. 
                    Our trainers are all Les Mills accredited instructors and are second to none – all have 
                    Bachelor Degrees in Human Movements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. 
                    Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms 
                    speak for themselves, our members do our marketing. We believe that word of mouth has way more 
                    credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.  You are always welcome to look 
                    through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever. With hard-selling 
                    'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a 
                    refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with 
                    our $10 CASUAL visit rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with 
                    our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends & public holidays. 
                    WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late 
                    night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our 
                    class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.
